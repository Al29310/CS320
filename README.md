# CS320

For these assignments I made sure my code was functional and secure by using unit testing. This involved using the junit framework. I would implement and test individual methods of my class. If it ran as intended then I would move onto another method. However if this was not the case and there were errors present, I would have to modify this particular, faulty piece of code until it worked. Piece by piece I would test all the class functions, and once they were all tested and ran as intended I would move onto testing another class.

Once user needs are gathered, they can be broken down into functional and non functional requirements. Then these requirements are implemented.
I believe designing software is a layered process. First one must gather the requirements that make up the intended system. Then the right tools must be used(programming language, databases etc) to accomplish this task. Once a product is complete it must be tested to ensure it fulfills all functional and non functional requirements.
